* Reveal.js support
To enable the export of your org file as a [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/][reveal.js]] presentation, set the
variable =org-enable-reveal-js-support= to =t=. This will install the [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/][org-reveal]]
extension.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '((org :variables org-enable-reveal-js-support t)))
#+END_SRC

In order to be able to use org-reveal, download =reveal.js= from its
[[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/][homepage]] and set =org-reveal-js= to the
download path, as described in the [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal#obtain-revealjs][manual]]. Alternatively, add the following line
to each =.org= file you want to process:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+REVEAL_ROOT: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/
#+END_EXAMPLE
